14/5

+ Had meeting with Carolina, she suggested some changes, as a result the first fork was generated, pre-meeting build is saved as 'Master'.
+ She suggested that there should be no preprocessing, i.e., no wavelett filtering or gain correction.
+ Discussed showing images as log_images but decided not to do that.
+ Decided no to use a colormap for display.
+ Decided to allocate the BG by percentage of peaks.
+ Decided to sample a subset from the FG and grade that subset using 2AFC.

- Changes have meant that most of the FG peaks are not being graded.
- BG is very large may be decrease it randomly.
